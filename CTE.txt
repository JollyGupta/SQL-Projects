The common table expression (CTE) is a powerful construct in SQL that helps simplify a query. CTEs work as virtual tables (with records and columns), created during the execution of a query, used by the query, and eliminated after query execution.

CTE benefits
CTEs make code more readable. And readability makes queries easier to debug.

CTEs can reference the results multiple times throughout the query. By storing the results of the subquery, you can reuse them throughout a larger query.

CTEs can help you perform multi-level aggregations. Use CTEs to store the results of aggregations, which you can then summarize in the main query.
